The autonomous robotic system is a key objective pursued by many researchers in the field of robotics. In recent years, advancements in state estimators, motion planning algorithms, 3D representations, and even large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of efforts aimed at achieving autonomy through Active SLAM. This approach has become a focal point for developing systems capable of navigating and interacting with complex environments independently.

This repository organizes relevant papers in the Active SLAM domain according to the author's perspective. It is important to note that the classification used in the repository reflects the author's viewpoint; in reality, many similar works are difficult to categorize satisfactorily.

## 2 Active SLAM

> Note: It is important to note that many studies claim to be "Active SLAM," yet most of them are primarily focused on Robotics Exploration. We contend that a true Active SLAM approach should prioritize the accuracy of both localization and mapping, actively optimizing these aspects by incorporating mechanisms such as an active loop closure module.

## 4 Active Reconstruction/Mapping

> In practice, it is challenging to distinctly differentiate between Active Reconstruction/Mapping tasks and Robotic Exploration tasks, as illustrated in the diagram above. Both involve the intersection of planning and mapping; however, their focus has notable differences. Active Reconstruction/Mapping emphasizes the quality of reconstructing entire scenes or objects, typically utilizing 3D frontiers and viewpoints. In contrast, Robotic Exploration prioritizes rapid coverage and efficiency, often employing 2D frontiers to optimize speed.
